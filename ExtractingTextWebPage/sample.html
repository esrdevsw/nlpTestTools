        <i>Future directions for the World Wide Web</i>
    </h2>
    <p>Having summarized the origins of the Web, and its current state, we now look at some possible
        directions in which developments could take it in the coming years. One can separate these into three
        long term goals. The first involves the improvement of the infrastructure, to provide a more functional,
        robust, efficient and available service. The second is to enhance the web as a means of
        communication and interaction between people. The third is to allow the web, apart from being a
        space browseable by humans, to contain rich data in a form understandable by machines.</p>
    <h3> Infrastructure </h3>
    <p>When the web was designed, the fact that anyone could start a server, and it could run happily on the
        Internet without regard to registration with any central authority or with the number of other HTTP
        servers which others might be running was seen as a key property, which enabled it to "scale". Today,
        such scaling is not enough. The numbers of clients is so great that the need is for a server to be able
        to operate more or less independently of the number of clients.</p>
    <p>Another cause for evolution is the fact that business is now relying on the Web to the extent that
        outages of servers or network are not considered acceptable. One would prefer an adaptive system
        which would configure itself so as to best use the resources available to the various communities to
        optimize the quality of service perceived. This is not a simple problem.</p>
    <p>It includes the problems of:</p>
    <Ol type=i>
        <li>categorizing documents and users so as to be able to treat them in groups;</li>
        <li>anticipating high usage of groups of documents by groups of users;</li>
        <li>deciding on optimal placement of copies of data for rapid access;</li>
        <li>an algorithm for finding the cheapest or nearest copy, given a URL;</li>
        <li>Resolution of these problems must occur within a context in which different areas of the infrastructure
            are funded through different bodies with different priorities and policies.</li>
    </Ol>
    <p>
        <i>These are some of the long term concerns about the infrastructure, the basic architecture of the web. In the
            shorter term, protocol designers are increasing the efficiency of HTTP communication, particularly for the
            case of a user
            whose performance limiting item is a telephone modem.</i>
